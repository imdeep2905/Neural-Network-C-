# Neural-Network-CPP
To understand neural networks thoroughly I implemented them from scratch in C++. This is the source code for the same. Code is well documented and well written.

I also contributed this code to [The Algorithms](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/C-Plus-Plus). You can checkout automatically genrated documentation [here](https://thealgorithms.github.io/C-Plus-Plus/d4/df4/classmachine__learning_1_1neural__network_1_1_neural_network.html). Feel free to use this code anyway you like. Checkout [```example_usage.cpp```](https://github.com/imdeep2905/Neural-Network-CPP/blob/master/example_usage.cpp) for quick demo on how to use ```nn.hpp```.
